# Lynx canadensis vs. Lepus americanus
The classic biology case study of the relationship between numbers of predators and their prey.
This R script was an assignment for my first ever programming class. I remember haitng the stuff at first, my brain couldn't make sense of it.
But the class was great because it was challenging, and that made me want to succeed even more.
I was recently making a map in ArcGIS JS API and thinking how far I had come in my programming skills since this. 
And man, it really isn't that far.
